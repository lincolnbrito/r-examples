  operators used to assign values to variables
  
  <-, <<-, =  leftwards assignment
  ->, ->>     rightwards assignment
  
  The operators <- and = can be used, almost interchangeably, to assign to variable in the same environment.
  The <<- operator is used for assigning to variables in the parent environments (more like global assignments). The rightward assignments, although available are rarely used.
